# AutoClickerTkinterSimple
AutoClicker with a ttkbootstrap GUI.

I developed this tool for the Steam Desktop Version of "CookieClicker", but it can be utilized in any context where automatic mouse clicking is needed.

This tool solely automates mouse button clicks and does not perform additional actions such as purchasing buildings in CookieClicker or similar tasks.

You have the option to toggle a boolean to display an extra button and showcase the current mouse position in the terminal.

Additionally, you can choose to keep the window always on top for added convenience.
